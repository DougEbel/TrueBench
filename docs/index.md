# TrueBench

Modern systems change constantly — often without any single team owning the change.

- AI generates code
- Open source updates silently
- Cloud platforms evolve continuously

Systems behave differently even when nothing ‘changed’.

TrueBench provides regression observability for systems whose behavior is shaped by AI, open source, and continuous change. 
- This is not monitoring. 
- This is not testing. 
- This is performance invariance validation.
